# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The objective of this analysis is to gain more information from Pewlett-Hackard's (PH), my hypothetical employer's, employee database. PH is concerned about its aging workforce and is considering a program where employees close to retirment step back somewhat from their current responsibilities and train the upcoming generation. This analysis uses criteria provided from internal stakeholders looking to launch this mentorship program hoping to identify a population of the employee base eligible for the program. The explicit goal of the analysis can subsequently be summarized as follows:
  1. determine the number of retiring employees, per [job] title
  2. and, identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program


## Results
Please see the below for a few of the major points from the two analysis deliverables. 

- The organization's senior roles are about to see a sizeable exodus of talent; 29,414 senior engineers and 28,255 senior staffers are approaching retirement.
- There mid tier roles are seeing less but still a significant exodus of talent; 14,222 engineers, 12,242 staff, and 4,502 technique leaders.
- For future consideration, only two "managers" are eligible leading us to ask what the demographics are of our "managers" and what that means for the organization (ie. are the managers all particularly young or is the title outdated in our organization).


## Summary: 
Here are a few high-level responses to some questions we thought you would find pressing.

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

 90,398 eligible candidates for retirement program

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

If each of the senior engineers and senior staffers mentor roughly two to 3 mentees each, there will be enough mentors in their respective departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard.
